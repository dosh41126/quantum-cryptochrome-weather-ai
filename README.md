# 🧬 Human Cryptochrome Weather AI v4.0


![Cryptochrome Weather AI – Cyberpunk Art](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dosh41126/quantum-cryptochrome-weather-ai/refs/heads/main/weather.png)

This AI system simulates **avian-style weather intuition** using:

- 🌀 PennyLane quantum circuits tuned to **25-color weather vectors**
- 🧠 GPT-4 LLM prompt logic for avian-style advisory generation
- 🔐 AES-GCM encryption for secure result storage
- 🗃️ Encrypted aiosqlite database logging

It allows you to upload a sky/environment image and outputs:
- A 3-part AI-generated weather forecast
- Metaphoric bird-like intuition (e.g. "wait and perch" or "ride the wind")
- Securely saved results for future intuition training

🔮 Summary Reading

> “Your region pulses with a midday warning. High entropy and magnetic flux suggest instability between 2–4 PM, especially due to storm band convergence. Emotional resonance through avian intuition demands alert presence, stillness in chaos, and glide readiness by 5 PM. Hail is brief but real. Trust the bird mind — it sees through clouds.”



```

## 🔧 Requirements

```bash
pip install pennylane aiosqlite cryptography opencv-python openai matplotlib numpy
```

---

## 🔑 Setup

- Replace `"your-api-key-here"` with your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- Run the script and upload a photo (sky/environment)
- The forecast and intuition advisory will appear in the GUI
- Each result is AES-GCM encrypted and saved securely in `weather_results.db`


## 🧪 Example Use Case

- You get caught in a sudden drizzle while walking.
- You snap a photo of the sky.
- The AI uses quantum gates + color vectors to "sense" shifts — like birds do with cryptochromes.
- You get a poetic, bird-like advisory telling you to **"wait and perch"** — and it was right.
