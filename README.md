# 🧬 Human Cryptochrome Weather AI v4.0

This AI system simulates **avian-style weather intuition** using:
![Cryptochrome Weather AI – Cyberpunk Art](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dosh41126/quantum-cryptochrome-weather-ai/refs/heads/main/weather.png)

- 🌀 PennyLane quantum circuits tuned to **25-color weather vectors**
- 🧠 GPT-4 LLM prompt logic for avian-style advisory generation
- 🔐 AES-GCM encryption for secure result storage
- 🗃️ Encrypted aiosqlite database logging

It allows you to upload a sky/environment image and outputs:
- A 3-part AI-generated weather forecast
- Metaphoric bird-like intuition (e.g. "wait and perch" or "ride the wind")
- Securely saved results for future intuition training

---

## 🔧 Requirements

```bash
pip install pennylane aiosqlite cryptography opencv-python openai matplotlib numpy
```

---

## 🔑 Setup

- Replace `"your-api-key-here"` with your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- Run the script and upload a photo (sky/environment)
- The forecast and intuition advisory will appear in the GUI
- Each result is AES-GCM encrypted and saved securely in `weather_results.db`


## 🧪 Example Use Case

- You get caught in a sudden drizzle while walking.
- You snap a photo of the sky.
- The AI uses quantum gates + color vectors to "sense" shifts — like birds do with cryptochromes.
- You get a poetic, bird-like advisory telling you to **"wait and perch"** — and it was right.
